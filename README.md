# Cosmic Encounter Utilities

A utility to make picking aliens in Cosmic Encounter games easier. Can be found at <http://www.fmorel.net/cosmic/> and on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.fmorel.cosmicgenerator).

## Actions

### Draw

Will give out a number of choices based on the "# per player" option until it runs out.

### Hide
Will hide the options you were given. Useful before letting someone else use the page. The button changes to *Show* to let you bring them back (but asks for the initial of one of the choices to discourage cheating).

### Redo
Will put the current picks back in the pool and give out new ones. This is useful for aliens like the Reincarnator, where you want a random alien, if you're ok with repeats.

### Reset
Resets list of aliens given out and to give out. Changing any of the Include/Exclude options will also reset the list.

## Other Things to Note

### Prevent Conflicts option
This one is permanently on to avoid games with conflicting aliens like the Oracle and Magician.

### "!" badge on aliens
That means the alien has Game Setup or conflicts with another alien. For details on any alien, click the "+" button.

### So much purple!
I really like purple.
